# Kinetics
Welcome to the Physics Team! This is the kinetics repository where you can (and you should ONLY) create calculators/simulations related to kinetics.
Our primary language is Python (3.10 or 3.11) If you prefer coding with other languages, please leave me a note before you start.
Learn about physics before you start.
